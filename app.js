const life = 100; // constant stays the same you can't make const=1000
// var lets you change the value but const stays the same

// instead just use let [name]



/* this is the old way of creating variables

var life = 100; //notes, this is not computed 

life = life - 10 ;
var name = 'Dev ed';

var checkout = true;

var box = null;
console.log(life) ;

variables are boxes where you can add different types of data.
-how to write a variable
 1) var 

 make sure to put the quotes to denote names

 whats a boolean?
 say we have a shopping website and we have a check out button, but we only want the button available once there are products in the basket. 
  a boolean is a value of true or false
  imagine it kind of like a switch.

 What is undefined?
 variable that doesn't have a value, there is a variable but it's not defined

 WHat is null?
 variable has non value, it is not commonly used. has a value of nothing?
